# Peolia — Session Handoff

**Last updated: 2026-06-12.** App is working end-to-end on device (Expo Go, Android, tunnel mode).
Votes, likes, pins, voices, follow, share, profile edit, and the view-reacts lock all function.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Expo SDK 56 + React Native 0.85 + Expo Router v56 (entry only) |
| Navigation | Custom tab system in `src/app/index.tsx` (NOT expo-router tabs) |
| Auth + DB | Supabase (`@supabase/supabase-js` v2), project in ap-northeast-2 Seoul |
| Storage | AsyncStorage for session persistence |
| Deep links | `expo-linking` + Supabase PKCE flow, scheme `liveopinionfeed` |
| Design system | `src/utils/peoliaScale.js` (fs/ms/vs/s) + `src/constants/peoliaTheme.js` |

## Build Config — DO NOT DELETE THESE FILES

Both files were created 2026-06-12 to fix "stuck at 99% bundling" + blank white screen:

- **`metro.config.js`** — `getDefaultConfig(__dirname)` from `expo/metro-config`. Without it,
  Metro never learns the router root is `src/app` (falls back to non-existent `app/`), Expo Router
  finds zero routes, and the app renders a blank white screen with no error.
- **`babel.config.js`** — `babel-preset-expo` with `'react-compiler': false`. Do NOT add
  `react-native-reanimated/plugin` or `react-native-worklets/plugin` manually — babel-preset-expo
  v56 auto-detects and adds the worklets plugin; adding it again runs the transform twice and
  hangs Metro at 99%.
- `app.json` has `"reactCompiler": false` — React Compiler hangs Metro on this codebase's
  `useRef(callback).current` patterns. Keep it off.

**Tunnel mode required** on this network (LAN blocked): `npx expo start --tunnel --clear`.
`@expo/ngrok` is installed as a devDependency to keep the tunnel stable.

## File Structure (post-cleanup — all Expo starter files deleted)

```
src/
  app/
    _layout.tsx          — SafeAreaProvider + ErrorBoundary + deep-link handler
    index.tsx            — Root: tab state, auth state, navigation orchestration
  screens/
    SentariumScreen.jsx  — Main 9:16 paged feed (sentarium_feed view, cursor pagination)
    TrendingScreen.jsx   — Top 20 by velocity_2h, wave filter pills
    FloatScreen.jsx      — Create senti (preview sub-screen, media stubs for Sprint 2/3)
    PinScreen.jsx        — Pinned sentis, direct-tap unpin (optimistic)
    ProfileScreen.jsx    — Own + other citizen, DNA radar chart, follow, edit profile
    AuthScreen.jsx       — Login / signup / forgot / reset-password
  components/
    SentiCard.jsx        — Card: WavePill + VoteBar + ActionBar + ViewReactsSheet
    ActionBar.jsx        — Like / voice / pin / ask column
    VoteBar.jsx          — Yes/Hmm/Nah; results after vote or view-lock
    ViewReactsSheet.jsx  — MODAL (blocks all background taps) — confirm before viewing reacts
    VoiceSheet.jsx       — Modal bottom sheet for voices (comments)
    EditProfileSheet.jsx — Modal: edit username / display_name / bio
    WaveImageSheet.jsx   — Modal: FloatScreen image picker (presets grid + Photos)
    TabBar.jsx, WavePill.jsx, ErrorBoundary.jsx
  constants/peoliaTheme.js   — colors (getPeoliaColors), typography, spacing — DO NOT BREAK
  utils/peoliaScale.js       — fs/ms/vs/s scaling — DO NOT BREAK
  lib/supabase.js            — client (env vars) + subscribeToTable helper — DO NOT MODIFY CONFIG
supabase/
  migration.sql          — STALE (old opinions/votes schema). Real schema lives in dashboard only.
  seed-sentis.sql        — seed data for sentis
  sprint2-feed-avatar-and-images.sql — view v2 + senti-images bucket (see SQL PENDING below)
```

Deleted 2026-06-12 (do not resurrect): `App.js`, `FeedScreen`, `CreateScreen`, `SavedScreen`,
`ScreenWrapper`, `UserProfileScreen`, `src/app/explore.tsx`, all `themed-*`/`app-tabs`/
`animated-icon`/starter components, `src/hooks/`, `src/constants/theme.ts`, starter assets.
Removed deps: `@expo/ui`, `expo-glass-effect`, `expo-symbols`, `expo-web-browser`.

## Database (Supabase, public schema)

**Tables:** sentis, senti_reactions, senti_counts (trigger-maintained — never write),
senti_likes, senti_pins, senti_view_locks, voices, follows (follower_id, following_id),
users (id, username, display_name, bio), user_stats, user_wave_stats.

**Views:** `sentarium_feed` (feed queries), `trending_sentis` (velocity_2h desc).

**SQL already applied in dashboard (2026-06-12):**
1. `SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path = public` on all trigger functions of senti_likes /
   senti_pins / senti_reactions / voices — fixed RLS 42501 on senti_counts writes.
2. `ALTER TABLE sentis ALTER COLUMN status SET DEFAULT 'approved'` — client no longer sends
   status (moderation can be enabled later by flipping this default to 'pending').
3. `users.display_name` + `users.bio` columns added + `users_update_own` RLS policy
   (UPDATE USING/WITH CHECK auth.uid() = id).

**SQL applied + verified (2026-06-12, `supabase/sprint2-feed-avatar-and-images.sql`):**
1. `sentarium_feed` v2 — old view returned stale `'??'` initials and had NO `user_id`,
   so the creator avatar showed nothing useful and could never navigate. v2 computes
   initials from username and appends `user_id` + `avatar_url`. Confirmed: feed now
   returns `avatar_initials: "K"`, `user_id`, `avatar_url`.
2. `senti-images` storage bucket — public read, 5 MB cap, jpeg/png/webp; authenticated
   upload restricted to own `{user_id}/` folder. Confirmed: a real image float uploaded
   and is publicly readable. The `presets/` subfolder (for the preset picker) is listable
   by anon and managed via the dashboard.

**Rules:** votes immutable (`ignoreDuplicates: true` upsert); one like/pin per user per senti
(toggle insert/delete); always filter sentis by `status = 'approved'`; cursor pagination only.
`users.avatar_initials` is a STALE stored column ('??') — never read it; derive the letter
from `username` client-side.

---

## Navigation

All in `src/app/index.tsx` via `activeTab` state. Tab keys:
`trending | float | sentarium | pin | profile` + hidden `auth | reset-password`.

- Guest mode: sentarium + trending browsable; float/pin/profile and all interactions
  route to auth via `onRequireAuth()`. Exception: tapping a creator avatar opens their
  profile for guests too (Follow inside is a session-gated no-op).
- **Always use `goToTab(tab)`, never `setActiveTab` directly** (keeps `activeTabRef` in
  sync for the `onAuthStateChange` closure).
- Cross-screen: `onNavigateToUser(userId)` → ProfileScreen overlay;
  `handleNavigateToFeedOpinion(id)` → sets `feedScrollToId` + jumps to sentarium
  (SentariumScreen moves target to index 0).

---

## Key Patterns in SentariumScreen

- **Optimistic + rollback** on every action; per-senti in-flight guards
  (`perSentiLikeInFlight` / `perSentiPinInFlight` refs) block double-taps.
- **`rawCounts` { yes, hmm, nah }** on each feed item — REQUIRED for optimistic vote math.
  `results` only holds pct + formatted strings. Kept in sync in: `normalise()`, the realtime
  handler, and the vote-rollback refetch. If you touch vote logic, preserve all three.
- **Refs mirror state** (`likedSentisRef`, `pinnedSentisRef`, `sessionRef`, `sentisRef`)
  to avoid stale closures.
- Realtime: ONE channel for the visible card only (`subscribeToVisible`), removed on change.
- `batchFetchStates(ids)` — one query per page for votes/locks/likes/pins (not per-card).
- Feed dedupes by id on `fetchMore`; `keyExtractor` is plain `item.id`.
- Bottom sheets are all `Modal` components with `paddingBottom: vs(20) + insets.bottom`
  (Android nav-bar clearance via `useSafeAreaInsets`).

**Note:** committed to `main` as `5085294`.

## Changelog — 2026-06-12 second session (Sprint 2)

| Change | Where |
|---|---|
| Feed creator avatar fixed: letter derived from `username` (view's stored initials were stale '??') | SentariumScreen `normalise()` |
| Avatar tap → creator's profile (view v2 adds `user_id`); guests allowed, no auth gate | SentariumScreen, index.tsx overlay |
| Avatar restyled to ProfileScreen pattern: solid accent circle + white letter; renders `avatar_url` photo when set | SentiCard |
| Full-bleed senti image: absolute-fill expo-image + 0.48 black overlay, white text, transparent WavePill, light ActionBar | SentiCard, ActionBar `onImage` |
| Image picker: 9:16 crop → upload to `senti-images/{uid}/` → `image_url` on insert; thumbnail + remove in media row; real image in preview | FloatScreen |
| ProfileScreen renders `avatar_url` photo (letter = fallback) | ProfileScreen |
| `expo-image-picker` installed + config plugin | package.json, app.json |
| sentarium_feed v2 + senti-images bucket SQL | supabase/sprint2-feed-avatar-and-images.sql (**applied + verified** — feed returns user_id/avatar_url, initials = first letter, image upload confirmed) |
| **Fix: image cards showed only the wave** — content now wrapped in a `zIndex:1` layer above the absolute image/overlay (Android ignores paint order; same reason FloatScreen preview uses zIndex:1) | SentiCard `content` |
| Preset image picker: WaveImageSheet lists `senti-images/presets/` at runtime; tap a preset → URL used directly (no upload); Photos option still launches gallery | WaveImageSheet.jsx + FloatScreen |

**Presets — how to add images:** Supabase dashboard → Storage → `senti-images` → create/open
`presets/` folder → upload jpg/png/webp. They appear in the Float image sheet automatically
(anon list confirmed working; public-read policy covers it). No SQL, no rebuild.

## Known Issues

| Priority | Issue | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 🟡 | "View reacts" lock is cosmetic | `sentarium_feed` returns counts to all clients; lock only hides them in UI. Server-side enforcement needed if the rule must be hard. |
| 🟡 | Vote can silently no-op | If `batchFetchStates` fails, user may "vote" on an already-voted senti — `ignoreDuplicates` returns no error; UI shows new choice, DB keeps old. Consider `.select()` on upsert + reconcile. |
| 🟡 | Pin state not synced across screens | Unpin in PinScreen doesn't update SentariumScreen state until refetch. |
| 🟡 | `handleViewLocked` has no rollback | Minor violation of optimistic+rollback rule. |
| 🟢 | Voices double-count briefly | Optimistic +1 plus realtime update can flash +2; no suppress flag for voices. |
| 🟢 | SentiCard not memoized | Every realtime tick re-renders all mounted cards. Add React.memo + useCallback renderItem + getItemLayout. |
| 🟢 | Realtime channel churn on fast scroll | Debounce `subscribeToVisible` ~300ms. |
| 🟢 | 956KB MaterialSymbols font bundles | expo-router's own internal dependency (expo-symbols) — not removable from app side. |
| 🟢 | Schema not in repo | `migration.sql` is the OLD schema. Export real DDL to `supabase/schema.sql` (`supabase db dump`). |
| 🟢 | Zero tests | Start with pure helpers (buildResults, normalise, formatCount). |

## Future Development (priority order)

1. ~~**Sprint 2 — image picker**~~ DONE 2026-06-12 (senti images end-to-end). Remaining:
   **avatar upload** — picker in EditProfileSheet → storage → `users.avatar_url`
   (rendering already done in SentiCard + ProfileScreen).
2. **Voices polish** — realtime subscription while sheet open, pagination past 50,
   delete-own-voice.
3. **Report / block** — REQUIRED by Google Play for UGC apps before launch.
4. **OnboardingScreen** — splash, walkthrough, wave picker.
5. **NotificationsScreen** — nudges, voices, reacts (expo-notifications + Edge Function).
6. **Search** — Postgres full-text on sentis.question.
7. **Sprint 3 — Track feature** (FloatScreen stub exists).
8. **Production**: EAS Build for Play Store (Expo Go can't ship), SMTP for auth emails
   (SendGrid/Resend), moderation pipeline (flip status default to 'pending' + approval path).
9. **Perf pass**: React.memo SentiCard, getItemLayout, channel debounce.
